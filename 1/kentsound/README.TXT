Project: kSound - A very simple sound player
Author: Michael Kolling

This project the first assessment of the CO320 course at the
Computing Laboratory, University of Kent, 2006.


To use this project, create a SoundPlayerGUI object.

This player can play WAV, AIFF, and AU files with standard 22.050 kHz 
or 11.025 kHz sample rates. (This means that not all files stored in these
formats can be played -- the actual encoding matters.)
